    <h1> Harsha Sai Teja acts in a play </h1>
    <h2>Ghost's Act 3 by Henrik Ibsen</h2>
    <p>[The cork pops; he pours wine into one glass, and is about to pour it
        into the other.]
    </p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : [Holding her hand over it.] Thanks; not for me.</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Oh! won't you? Then I will!</p>
    
    <p>[He empties the glass, fills, and empties it again; then he sits down by
        the table.]
    </p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : [In expectancy.] Well?</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : [Without looking at her.] Tell me--I thought you and Pastor
        Manders seemed so odd--so quiet--at dinner to-day.</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : Did you notice it?</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Yes. H'm--[After a short silence.] Tell me: what do you think of
        Regina?</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : What do I think?</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Yes; isn't she splendid?</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : My dear Oswald, you don't know her as I do--</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Well?</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : Regina, unfortunately, was allowed to stay at home too
        long. I ought to have taken her earlier into my house.</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Yes, but isn't she splendid to look at, mother? [He fills his
        glass.]</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : Regina has many serious faults--</p>
    
    <p>OSWALD : Oh, what does that matter? [He drinks again.]</p>
    
    <p>MRS. ALVING : But I am fond of her, nevertheless, and I am responsible
        for her. I wouldn't for all the world have any harm happen to her.</p>
